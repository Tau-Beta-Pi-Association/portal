This is the directory for building the new 'portal' system. The Django framework is currently being utilized, and further planning/development of the database is required 
before we build out more features. A front-end framework (React/NextJS) may be needed in the future, depending on the features we decide to include. For the time being, 
Django is capable of accomplishing all tasks necessary to replicate and expand upon our legacy systems. Ryan Hubbuck is the lead developer and owner of this repo.
